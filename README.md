# Handwritten Digits Predictor using CNN

The Flask web applicatoin relies on a CNN that was trained on the MNIST dataset to classify images of handwritten digits ranging from 0-9. The trained model's weights and layers has been exported as a .h5 file that is used to access the model for prediction in the flask application.
